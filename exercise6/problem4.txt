4a) – Did you find something of interest in the solutions made by others?

I found different good examples on mainly plotting related things for matplotlib which I don't have any previous
knowledge of.

Also I found out about stating parameter and output types while defining the function:
e.g. def function(a: int, b: np.ndarray) -> int:
I think this is really good practise for the future.

b) 
– Mention two to four new / useful things you have enjoyed learning thus far in the course

I like that the course is in Python because that way I can also learn Python while learning all the computational
physics related things.
I've enjoyed learning about the FDM and FEM methods, because they seem really useful especially when the analytical
solution is not trivial to find.
In general I've enjoyed discretization in general, which to me feels like the most important subject
in many parts of computational physics. It is like approximating the space into a lattice.


– Do you think the subjects so far will benefit you in your future endeavors? Why?

I think these subjects will be very beneficial to me, since I hope to have a career which includes both
programming and physics.


– How well have you so far done personally? What has been challenging in the course so far? Have you been
able to schedule a suitable amount of time for the course?

I think I've done well enough to satisfy my own expections. I struggled a bit in the beginning jumping straight
to multidimensional integration with using only 1d methods, but after that the problems have been the good type
of challenging. I have probably scheduled a bit more time for this course compared to other courses but thankfully
the other courses don't require that much of time.

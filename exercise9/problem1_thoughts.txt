Efficiency of VMC can be improved by:
- Optimizing/guessing a better wave function (in this program, optimizing a)
- Jastrow factor can be optimized by using different b1 values
- In the DMC simulations, the frequency of trial energy update and the optimized value of alpha
  may lead to more efficient calculations


- Wave function parameters for VMC can be optimized by running the VMC with different values
of parameters and observing the minimal variance, as done during the exercise. Also, a known 
wave function can be used by adding additional terms (for example Jastrow function).
